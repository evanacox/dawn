# dawn

A scrappy compiler middle and back-end library.

## Introduction

Dawn is a compiler middle-end and back-end library, heavily inspired by the
design (and implementation) of LLVM. The main difference is that it's made by
a single person and made entirely for learning purposes (and fun!).

## Building
